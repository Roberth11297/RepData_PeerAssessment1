```{r}
data2<-with(data, tapply(steps, date, sum))
res<-data.frame(Date=ymd(names(data2)), Steps=data2)
hist(res$Steps, col="green", main = "Number of steps taken each day", xlab= "Steps")
```


- Mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
meand<-mean(res$Steps, na.rm = TRUE)
meand
mediand<-median(res$Steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mediand
```
